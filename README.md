- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicolelily
- 👀 I’m interested in data visualization in all its forms, from hand-drawn to created in Tableau to coded with Python or JavaScript libraries. I love data art and generative art, too, I just haven't had time to do much myself.
- ✍🏼 I blog about data visualization, Tableau, and mental health on **SELECT * FROM data;** on [Medium](https://medium.com/select-from-data) and [Substack](https://selectallfromdata.substack.com).
- 🎨 My portfolio of work in Tableau is on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicole.mark).
- 🌱 I’m currently brushing up on HTML and CSS and learning d3.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on dataviz projects, especially ones with a positive social impact.
- 📫 Reach me via [email](hello@nicoledesignsdata.com), on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nicolemark_) (for now, anyway), or `@nicolemark@vis.social`  or `nicole@indieweb.social` on Mastodon.
