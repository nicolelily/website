- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicole, a dataviz engineer, Tableau Ambassador, student in UC Boulder's master's degree in data science program, and founder of [Women in Dataviz](https://www.craft.do/s/KdYJAxSQyrF4PA).
- 👀 I’m interested in data visualization in all its forms, from hand-drawn to created in Tableau to coded with Python or JavaScript.  
- ✍🏼 I blog about data analytics, visualization, Tableau, and anything else that's on my mind at [SELECT * FROM data;](https://medium.com/select-from-data)
- 🎨 My portfolio of work in Tableau is on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicole.mark).
- 🌱 I’m currently brushing up on HTML and CSS and learning d3.js. I'm a new convert to Svelte.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on dataviz projects, especially ones with a positive social impact.
